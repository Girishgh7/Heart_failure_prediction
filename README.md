# Heart_failure_predictionðŸ’“

## Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning algorithms. It utilizes a dataset containing various medical parameters related to heart health and trains models to identify patterns and make predictions.

## Dataset

The project uses the "heart.csv" dataset, which includes features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and convert categorical variables into numerical representations.

## Methodology

The following steps are involved in the project:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** The dataset is loaded using Pandas, and missing values are handled by replacing them with the mean for numerical features. Duplicate rows are removed, and categorical features are converted to numerical representations using one-hot encoding.

2. **Feature Engineering and Selection:** Relevant features are selected based on their importance in predicting heart disease. Feature scaling is applied using StandardScaler to normalize the data.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation:** Various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, are trained on the preprocessed data. The models are evaluated using accuracy scores and confusion matrices.

4. **Model Comparison and Selection:** The performance of different models is compared, and the best-performing model is selected based on its accuracy and other evaluation metrics.

5. **Visualization:** The results are visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn to provide insights into the model's performance and the importance of different features.
